# Under the hood

This section describes the implementation of RTFM. This information is useful to both users of the
Cortex-M implementation of RTFM and developers interested in porting RTFM to other architectures.
The former group will get a better understanding of the performance characteristics of RTFM; the
latter group will get a high level overview of the Cortex-M implementation that they wouldn't
otherwise get from just reading the code.
